# Computational Poetry Generation

This project explores the generation of poetry using machine learning techniques, primarily focusing on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). The main goal is to create a system that can generate various forms of poetry, including sonnets and haikus, inspired by the works of Shakespeare and Spenser.

## Key Features:

- Data preprocessing of classical texts (Shakespeare and Spenser)
- Training of HMMs and RNNs on processed text data
- Generation of sonnets with controlled syllable counts
- Haiku generation with specific syllable patterns (5/7/5)
- Temperature-based text generation for varied creativity
- Syllable counting and dictionary management
- Incorporation of multiple source texts for diverse output

## Technologies Used:

- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Natural Language Processing techniques
- Custom implementations of HMMs
